She's a really strong girl and she's doing her absolute best to deal with any problems she's facing and would never give up no matter how hard. She makes me want to try my best to deal with my problems too. She might not realize it but she's helped me a lot and I don't know how I'll ever repay her, but just in case she hasn't heard this from anyone recently, it's coming from me. I'm so proud of you, beautiful. clue this girl has a cold looking eye ")
